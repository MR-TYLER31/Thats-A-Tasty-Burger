# Node Express Handlebars

## Overview

In this project you can create a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM. This app follows the MVC design patter and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. This application is designed with CRUD principles in mind allowing the user to 1. Add a Burger to the menu. 2. Devour the burger which places it in the Devoured side of the web page (this is done by a PUT request). 3. Delete the burger from the database and view.

## Instructions

To run the application make sure you are in the root folder of your director and run in your command line `npm install`. Once your packages are installed you can run `npm start` in your command line to star the application.
